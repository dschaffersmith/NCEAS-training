# Synthesis is awesome

## I've done a lot of work

- [Redbluff fish graph](Redbluff.html)
- Dave's longfin graph
- Dave's sturgeon graph
- Lara's SKT graphs

I can add HTML right into the markdown chunk


<img src = "skt_dsm_fig.png" class = "displayleft" alt = "this is a graph of the spring kodiak trawl index" />

If I want to write a comment in HTML, I need to type "<!" and then "--" with "--" and ">" at the end
<!--like this -->

Or I can just put my comments in a code chunk and use comments. 


```{r, fig.align= "center", echo = F}
include_graphics("skt_dsm_fig.png")
```
